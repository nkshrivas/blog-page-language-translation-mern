In the past, teams used to rely on their own methods for monitoring, which led to frequent system failures and disruptions. As the number of machines and the complexity of these systems increased, it used to become frustrating to be constantly alerted in the middle of the night about minor issues on one of the many servers. Unfortunately, there was not an existing open-source solution at the time that could effectively handle this problem. The available options were either too simple and lacked power, or too powerful to scale, or overly complicated for cloud environments. This created a remarkable need for a focused project that could address these monitoring challenges. Zurich's story is introduced when he decided to join a promising startup called SoundCloud in Berlin. SoundCloud aimed to become the top in the Cloud and had a talented team of engineers and an exciting culture. They soon discovered that SoundCloud was facing reliability and latency issues with its website, and it was difficult to identify the underlying causes of these problems. The existing monitoring tools couldn't manage constant changes in instances and microservices. SoundCloud already had its own system, which was a modern and ever-changing computing environment. However, the traditional monitoring tools struggled to provide insights into how the cluster was functioning. The main issues like latency spikes or increased error rates occurred, it was nearly impossible to pinpoint the specific process or determine if it affected the entire group of microservices. People started to realize the importance of monitoring, but there wasn't an integrated system that could fully leverage their potential. In recent years, many companies started using complex distributed systems but struggled to effectively track metrics in these ever-changing environments. There was a clear need for a solution. That's when Prometheus started a project. They began building a monitoring system from scratch in their free time. It was challenging to explain this new approach to others while simultaneously developing it. At SoundCloud, their main goal was to enhance platform reliability with limited resources for a project like Prometheus. New team members joined the project and started using Prometheus intensively. Prometheus adoption within SoundCloud was slow and gradual. Prometheus quickly gained attention in the open-source community after its release on GitHub. Companies started using it in production and contributing to its development. To ensure long-term growth and independence, Prometheus joined the Cloud Native Organization. This move allowed Prometheus to expand beyond SoundCloud's needs and capabilities.",

Docker's rise in popularity was taken by frequent discussions in the tech community, with articles appearing on platforms like Hacker News, further empowering the momentum. While Docker solved many challenges linked with packaging and distributing software, there was a realization that something more was needed to manage complex containerized applications effectively. This led to the development of Kubernetes. It was initiated by a small team within Google, including Brendan Burns, Joe Beda, and Craig McLuckie. Their aim was to create a platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The team leveraged their experience with Google's internal infrastructure management system, called Borg, to build Kubernetes. The journey of Kubernetes was not without its challenges. Initially, they faced difficulties in convincing Google's executive leadership about the benefits of open-sourcing the project. There were concerns about funding potential competitors. They sought feedback and collaborated with teams in different Google locations, including Mountain View and Seattle, combining their expertise in cloud technologies. The team's hard work paid off, and after multiple reviews and discussions, Kubernetes received approval to be open-sourced. The project was announced, and efforts were made to determine the codebase and involve more contributors, both from within and outside of Google. The industry witnessed competition between different container technologies, including Docker and Kubernetes. While Docker initially dominated the container landscape, Kubernetes emerged as the de facto standard for container simplification. Docker recognized the importance of Kubernetes and integrated it into their platform, making it easy for developers to use both technologies together. Looking ahead, Kubernetes continues to evolve. New advancements and features, such as serverless components and enhanced developer experiences, are being developed to address emerging needs. The cloud industry, fueled by the success of Docker and Kubernetes, is expected to undergo further transformations, with increased focus on efficient application deployment and management. In conclusion, the cloud industry witnessed a significant shift in 2013, with the emergence of Docker and Kubernetes playing pivotal roles. Docker revolutionized software development and deployment by simplifying the packaging and distribution of applications. Kubernetes further automated the management of containerized applications, leading to the widespread adoption of cloud-native architectures.
